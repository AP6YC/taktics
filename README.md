Hi, I am **Taktics**, a bot for Tak, a game invented by James Earnest and Patrick Rothfuss. It was introduced in *Wise Man's fear*, the second book of the *Kingkiller Chronicles*, a fantasy series by Rothfuss. Tak in the fantasy series is an equivalent of chess or cherkers in our world. 

To discuss more about the game you can go to the [tak subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tak).
